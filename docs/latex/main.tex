\section{Introduction}\label{main_intro_section}
Fast, thread safe C++ template with Least Recently Used (LRU) removal semantics. Complete with a comprehensive unit test suite. Threading features require the BOOST scientific library to be installed.\section{Usage}\label{main_usage_section}
An LRU cache is a fixed size cache that discards the oldest (least recently accessed) elements after it fills up. It's ideally suited to be used in situations where you need to speed up access to slower data sources (databases, synthetic structures, etc.). Below is a simple example of using it to cache strings using integer keys.\section{See Also}\label{main_also_section}
